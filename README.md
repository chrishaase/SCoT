SCoT (Sense Clustering over Time) is a web application to view the senses of a word and their evolvement over time. The idea is to help anyone interested in diachronic semantics visualize and compare the meanings a word had at different points in time.

The functionalities and usage are described in the user guide. If you would like to deploy SCoT yourself or keep working on it see the installation guide for developers for more information.

SCoT is developed since 2019. The project is maintained by the Language Technology Group at Universität Hamburg, which is led by Chris Biemann.

Developers include Saba Anwar, Christian Haase and Inga Kempfert (who developed the first version)

Supervisors include Seid Muhie Yimam in addition to Chris Biemann and Alexander Friedrich
