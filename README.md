# SCoT
A web application for interactive clustering of word senses over time.

SCoT (Sense Clustering over Time) is a web application to view the senses of a word and their evolvement over time. The idea is to help anyone interested in diachronic semantics visualize and compare the meanings a word had at different points in time.

The current updated version was mainly developed by Christian Haase (HITeC). It includes a mayor revision of the frontend (Vue, JS), new features (context information, multidatabase-connection) and revisions to the backend, including an overhaul of the REST-API. The initial version was mainly developed by Inga Kempfert.
